## Chart stack 

Chart stack is a bitcoin tracker site that is made using Spring MVC. The tracker fetches data using an api and updates based on desired filters for the data.

Everything on in this repository has been rebuilt from the barebone common project, to fit the MVC framework with Spring. Due to security reason the project has also been moved to a new reposiotry with no git history.
